OMERO.biobank documentation
===========================

Welcome to the documentation for OMERO.biobank |release|.
OMERO.biobank is a framework built upon `OMERO
<http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/omero>`_ that provides
compact and efficient ways to deal with the computational challenges
brought about by large scale biomedical studies.  The framework
provides models for entities such as laboratory samples, genotyping
and sequencing datasets and many more, together with data structures
and patterns for tracking the chains of actions that link one entity
to another.
