Ipython notebook based examples

The idea is to write biobank examples directly as 
notebooks and to generate 'static' documentation by converting
notebooks into rst. It is expected that this will simplify the tedious  
task of writing example code and maintaining it in phase with 
development.

Makefile has a ipynb to rst conversion as its default target, while
'make startnb' will start a local ipython notebook server.  

Ipython should be version 1.1 or above.
